Abstract 
Background:  The cattle tick is a parasite that adversely affects livestock performance in tropical areas. Although 
countries such as Australia and Brazil have developed genetic evaluations for tick resistance, these evaluations have 
not considered genotype by environment (G*E) interactions. Genetic gains could be adversely affected, since breed-
stock comparisons are environmentally dependent on the presence of G*E interactions, particularly if residual vari-
ability is also heterogeneous across environments. The objective of this study was to infer upon the existence of G*E 
interactions for tick resistance of cattle based on various models with different assumptions of genetic and residual 
variability.
Methods:  Data were collected by the Delta G Connection Improvement program and included 10,673 records of tick 
counts on 4363 animals. Twelve models, including three traditional animal models (AM) and nine different hierarchi-
cal Bayesian reaction norm models (HBRNM), were investigated. One-step models that jointly estimate environmental 
covariates and reaction norms and two-step models based on previously estimated environmental covariates were 
used to infer upon G*E interactions. Model choice was based on the deviance criterion information.
Results:  The best-fitting model specified heterogeneous residual variances across 10 subclasses that were bounded 
by every decile of the contemporary group (CG) estimates of tick count effects. One-step models generally had 
the highest estimated genetic variances. Heritability estimates were normally higher for HBRNM than for AM. One-
step models based on heterogeneous residual variances also usually led to higher heritability estimates. Estimates 
of repeatability varied along the environmental gradient (ranging from 0.18 to 0.45), which implies that the rela-
tive importance of additive and permanent environmental effects for tick resistance is influenced by the environ-
ment. Estimated genetic correlations decreased as the tick infestation level increased, with negative correlations 
between extreme environmental levels, i.e., between more favorable (low infestation) and harsh environments (high 
infestation).
Conclusions:  HBRNM can be used to describe the presence of G*E interactions for tick resistance in Hereford and 
Braford beef cattle. The preferred model for the genetic evaluation of this population for tick counts in Brazilian cli-
mates was a one-step model that considered heteroscedastic residual variance. Reaction norm models are a power-
ful tool to identify and quantify G*E interactions and represent a promising alternative for genetic evaluation of tick 
resistance, since they are expected to lead to greater selection efficiency and genetic progress.

Background
The  cattle  tick  is  a  parasite  that  adversely  affects  beef 
cattle production in tropical areas such as Brazil. Retail 
beef markets are imposing restrictions on meat, ensuring 
that it is free of chemical residues that are perceived as 
having  negative  impacts  on  environment,  public  health 
and human welfare. Therefore, to remain competitive in 
foreign beef markets, Brazil must aim at complying with 
these higher standards.

To ensure market competitiveness, one strategy might 
be to increase the contribution of the Bos taurus breeds 
to  Brazilian  herds  because  they  are  more  advantageous 
in  terms  of  productive  traits  [1],  such  as  carcass  yield, 
gain weight, meat quality and sexual precocity compared 
to Bos indicus breeds. However, Bos taurus breeds tend 
to have greater susceptibility to tick infestation than Bos 
indicus breeds [2, 3]. Hence, selection of animals for tick 
resistance would be useful to reduce the need for chemi-
cal control while also increasing productivity.

Evidence for additive genetic variability of tick counts 
in  cattle  includes  reported  heritability  estimates,  which 
range from 0.05 to 0.42 [2, 4–6]. Genetic evaluations for 
tick counts are routinely performed in countries such as 
Australia and South Africa, which have a similar climate 
as Brazil and where the cattle tick is also present. Exam-
ples of breeds with such evaluations include breeds such 
as  Bonsmara  and  Belmont  Red  [7],  and  Brahman  and 
Hereford-Shorthorn)  [8].  In  Brazil,  the  Conexão  Delta 
G  (Delta  G  Connection)  company  has  used  a  genetic 
improvement program based on selection for tick resist-
ance in Hereford and Braford cattle since 2003 [9].

These  and  other  research  studies  and  genetic  evalua-
tions [7, 9] have not considered genotype by environment 
interactions  (G*E).  Failing  to  consider  G*E  interactions 
in genetic evaluations can adversely affect breeding pro-
grams if relative genetic merit is affected by the environ-
ment  [10–13];  specifically,  animals  that  are  identified 
as top breeders in one environment may not be ideal in 
other environments. This issue is further exacerbated if 
progeny are raised in environments that differ from that 
of  their  parents  [13].  In  addition,  most  current  genetic 
evaluation  systems  assume  homogeneous  residual  vari-
ances across environments, although evidence of residual 
heteroscedacity  has  been  reported,  which  is  defined  as 
heterogeneity of residual variances across contemporary 
groups, for traits such as milk yield [14] and post-wean-
ing gain [10, 15].

Linear reaction norm models capture a simple form of 
G*E interactions. They are based on the use of covariance 
functions [16] that allow for the prediction of the relative 
genetic  merit  of  animals  as  a  function  of  gradual  linear 
changes  in  an  environmental  covariate.  Sometimes  this 
environmental covariate is not known with certainty and 

must  be  estimated  from  the  data;  Su  et  al.  [17]  demon-
strated  how  this  inference  uncertainty  could  be  formally 
accounted for by using Bayesian methods. If G*E interac-
tions are important for tick resistance, reaction norm mod-
els could be used to fine-tune genetic improvement for tick 
resistance  in  Brazilian  beef  cattle.  Because  G*E  interac-
tions contribute to heterogeneous genetic variability across 
environments, if heteroscedastic residual variability across 
environments  is  ignored,  inferences  on  G*E  interactions 
based on reaction norm models could be biased.

The objective of this study was to infer upon G*E inter-
actions  based  on  models  with  different  assumptions 
regarding the nature of genetic and residual variation and 
with different approaches to account for uncertainty on 
environmental gradient.

Methods
Tick count data
Data  used  in  this  current  study  were  obtained  from  a 
breeding program conducted by Conexão Delta G (Delta 
G Connection). Data included records of tick counts (TC) 
on Hereford and Braford beef cattle from eight herds from 
the Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. TC were obtained on 
each animal from 326 to 729 days of age using the method 
described  by  Wharton  and  Utech  [18],  for  which  all 
engorged female ticks larger than 4.5 mm were counted 
on the entire left side of the animal when average man-
agement  group  infestation,  i.e.,  animals  under  the  same 
feeding and sanitary management, exceeded 20 ticks per 
animal. Up to three such counts were obtained for each 
animal,  with  each  count  separated  by  a  minimum  of 
30 days, as described in other studies [5, 19, 20]. A total of 
241, 1934 and 2188 animals for which, respectively, one, 
two and three TC were recorded. The average age during 
the evaluation period was 524 ± 65 days, and the overall 
mean TC was equal to 35.0 with a standard deviation of 
42.2 (ranging from 0 to 532).

The  4363  animals  with  records  were  born  between 
2008  and  2011  and  originated  from  604  sires  and  3966 
dams, with 10 generations of pedigree depth. A total of 
11,967  animals  remained  after  pedigree  pruning  (i.e., 
removing any terminal ancestors that occur only once in 
the pedigree file). Pedigree information was incomplete 
due to the use of multiple-sire matings; 36 % of the ani-
mals  only  had  their  dam  known.  For  animals  with  TC, 
this increased to 65 %. Similar pedigree structures from 
this  same  population  have  been  used  in  other  studies 
[20],  and  they  have  not  affected  the  results  of  genetic 
evaluation. A detailed breakdown of the pedigree struc-
ture is in Table 1.

Because  TC  were  not  normally  distributed  (Fig.  1),  a 
log-transformation  was  used  such  that  LTTC  =  log10 
(TC + 1.001), which was used as the response variable [1,

Statistical models
Twelve analyses based on different models and/or infer-
ential methodologies and specifications on residual vari-
ability  were  conducted  on  the  data.  These  analyses  are 
described  below  as  M1  to  M12  and  are  summarized  in 
Table 2.

Traditional animal model (AM)
Consider  the  following  simple  linear  traditional  animal 
model (M1):

yijk = x′

j β + wi + aj + cj + eijk .

(1)
Here, yijk is the kth LTTC record of animal j from CG i, 
β  is  the  vector  of  fixed  effects  that  includes  an  overall 
intercept, linear regression coefficients for Nellore breed 
proportion, heterozygosity and recombination loss (pre-
determined by Cardoso et al. [9]), as well as linear and 
quadratic regression coefficients on age of the animal; x′j 
is the known incidence row vector of covariates connect-
ing β to yijk; wi is the random effect of CG i (i = 1, 2, . . . , 
146 levels); aj is the random additive genetic effect of ani-
mal j; cj is the random permanent environmental effect of 
animal j; and eijk is the residual error.

20]. The constant 1.001 was included because some TC 
were equal to 0 [1, 20]. Skewness and kurtosis tests were 
performed  and  ensured  the  normality  of  the  residuals 
from the fitted models.

Contemporary groups (CG) were defined as groups of 
animals  within  the  same  herd,  year  of  birth,  season  of 
birth  (April–July;  August–November  and  December–
March), sex and from the same management group. From 
11,316 observations, we selected 10,673 records pertain-
ing to 146 CG with at least five animals and with each 
LTTC  record  being  within  3.5  standard  deviation  (SD) 
from its specific CG. Connectedness among the CG was 
determined  by  each  having  more  than  10  genetic  links 
in  the  dataset,  using  the  AMC  software  [21].  Estimates 
of  CG  effects  on  LTTC  were  assumed  to  be  the  envi-
ronmental  covariates  for  a  linear  reaction  norm  model 
because  they  are  the  most  appropriate  entities  used  to 
describe  the  environmental  conditions  for  beef  cattle 
production [10, 22, 23].

Hierarchical bayesian reaction norm models (HBRNM)
Two  somewhat  different  approaches  were  used  to 
estimate  environmental  sensitivities  of  animals.  One 
approach was based on a commonly used two-step model 
[24,  25],  in  which  in  the  first  step,  the  regular  animal 
model (M1) from Eq. (1) is used to estimate CG effects ŵi. 
The second step consists of using these ŵi estimates as if 
they were “known” environmental covariates in a linear 
reaction norm model. More specifically, posterior means 
of ŵi obtained from M1 were used as covariate values in 
the following reaction norm model (M2).
yijk = x′
(2)
Here, φ is an overall linear regression coefficient of yijk on 
ŵi; aj is the additive genetic intercept of animal j pertain-
ing to genetic merit for an average environment (ŵi = 0); 
bj  is  the  random  additive  genetic  effect  of  the  reaction 
norm slope of animal j on ŵi; cj is the non-genetic (e.g., 
permanent environmental effect) intercept of animal j, as 
defined for an average environment (ŵi = 0); and dj is the 
random permanent environmental effect of the reaction 
norm slope of animal j on ŵi. Note that yijk, x′j β and eijk 
are defined as before.

j β + φ ˆwi + aj + bj ˆwi + cj + dj ˆwi + eijk .

Another two-step modeling strategy (M3) that is very 

j β + wi + aj + bj ˆwi + cj + dj ˆwi + eijk .

similar to M2 is given by Eq. (3):
yijk = x′
(3)
In M3, contemporary group effects are refitted as ran-
dom effects rather than being treated as known covari-
ates,  such  that  M3  may  be  more  flexible  than  M2  for 
modeling CG effects. Nevertheless, ŵi was again used as 
a “known” covariate in the random regression portion of 
the model.

Including ŵi as if it is a “known” covariate in the sec-
ond step of this approach is clearly a limitation that may 
understate  statistical  uncertainty  and  lead  to  biased 
predictions  on  animal  genetic  merit.  These  biases  may 
be  due  to  genetic  trend,  differences  in  environmental 
covariate values across CG, or both [10, 17]. An appeal-
ing  one-step  approach  that  avoids  these  limitations  of 
the  two-step  approach  was  proposed  by  Su  et  al.  [17]. 
This  approach  is  purely  Bayesian  in  that  the  covariate 

associated with the reaction norm is treated as unknown, 
which allows inferences for all unknowns together within 
a one-step linear reaction norm model (M4):
yijk = x′
(4)
Model M4 can be rewritten in matrix notation as below 
[17]:

j β + wi + aj + bjwi + cj + djwi + eijk .

y = Xβ + Pw + Zaa + Zbb + Zcc + Zdd + e,

(5)
where  y =  {yijk}  is  the  nx1  vector  of  observations;  β  is 
the vector of fixed effects of order p;  w = {wi}nw
i=1 is the 
vector of environmental effects; a = {aj}q
j=1 is the vector 
of random genetic intercepts; b = {bj}q
j=1 is the vector of 
random genetic slopes; c = {cj}q
j=1 is the vector of random 
permanent environment intercepts; d = {dj}q
j=1 is the vec-
tor of random permanent environment slopes; and e is 
the nx1 vector of residuals. Matrices X, P, Za and Zc are 
known incidence matrices, where the column address of 
matrices Zb and Zd has exactly one element equal to the 
environmental covariate (wi or an estimate of wi) for that 
CG in the row address of the observation, with all other 
elements in that row equal to 0.

Prior distributional specifications
To infer environmental sensitivities using a hierarchical 
Bayesian model, three stages are required: the first stage 
defines the distribution of the observed data conditional 
on all other parameters [17]:
y|β, w, a, b, c, d, R ∼ N
(Xβ + Pw + Zaa + Zbb + Zcc + Zdd, R).

2  is  the  residual 
M1,  M2,  M3  and  M4,  R =  Iσe
variance and I is the identity matrix. However, as previ-
ously noted, it might be important to model residual het-
eroscedasticity. We propose two alternative strategies for 
this. The first heteroscedastic residual specification (S1) is 
defined by R = diag(cid:31)Ini σ2
ei(cid:30), a diagonal matrix with ele-
ments equal to σ2
e × η ˆwi and Ini denoting an iden-
ei
tity matrix of order ni, where ni is the number of records 
in the ith CG. Here, η is an unknown scaling parameter 
that characterizes the degree of heterogeneity of residual 
variance across environments, and ŵi is the solution for 
the ith CG [26].

Based  on  S1,  we  tested  two  two-step  approaches  (M6 
and M7) that used inferred values of ŵi from M1 as if they 
were known and a one-step reaction norm model (M8), 
where wi is an unknown covariate that is jointly inferred 
with the reaction norm and η parameters. Model M6 was 
a heteroscedastic residual extension of M2, whereas M7 
and  M8  were  heteroscedastic  residual  extensions  of  M3 
and M4, respectively.

Page 5 of 12

Another heteroscedastic residual specification (S2) was 
based  on  residual  variance  subclasses  determined  by  a 
decile-based  classification  of  ŵi,  following  Cardoso  and 
Tempelman [10]. That is, CG were ordered into one of 10 
categories based on decile delimiters of ŵi obtained from 
M1,  such  that  R  =  diag(cid:31)Ink σ2
e γk(cid:30),  where  the  order  nk 
denotes the number of records delimited by deciles k − 1 
and k, and was 1157, 1174, 1047, 765, 1188, 1192, 1208, 
918,  1150  and  874,  respectively,  for  k = 1, 2, . . . ,  and 
10.  This  specification  was  used  to  extend  the  two-step 
models  M2–M10  and  M3–M11  and  the  one-step  model 
M4–M12  with  this  particular  heteroscedastic  residual 
specification.

The last two models considered (M5 and M9) were het-
eroscedastic residual animal models based on extending 
M1 with S1 and S2 heteroscedastic residual specifications, 
and were used as control models to determine the conse-
quences of failing to model G*E interactions versus fail-
ing to model residual heteroscedasticity [10].

The  second  stage  of  HBRNM  is  represented  by  the 
prior distributions of the location parameters, as follows:

specifying  an  inverted  gamma  (IG)  distribution  for 
the  variance  of  the  contemporary  group  effects,  i.e.,

ual  variances,  additional  hierarchical  specifications  were 
required, depending on the nature of the function (S1 or 
S2)  chosen,  i.e.:  η|αη, βη ∼ p(η|αη, βη) = IG(αη, βη),  for 
S1or  γk|αγ ∼ p(cid:31)γk|αγ(cid:30) = IG(cid:31)αγ, αγ − 1(cid:30),  k = 1, 2, . . . , 10 
for S2 [10, 27, 28]. We specified αη = −1 and βη = 0, where 
the prior p(αγ) on αγ was a gamma with shape and scale 
hyperparameter values of 0.03 and 0.01, respectively [10]. 
This  assumption  leads  to  a  prior  mean  of  αγ  equal  to  3 
[E(αγ) = 3] and a large prior variance (var(αγ ) = 300) [27].
Due to the absence of relevant previous knowledge, flat 
or highly dispersed prior densities were assumed for all 
parameters of all models, and hyperparameters for vari-
ance  components  priors  were  specified  on  the  basis  of 
REML estimates obtained by M1 and M2 (not shown).

Bayesian inference
Bayesian analyses were conducted to sample all param-
eters from their fully conditional posterior distributions. 
Gibbs sampling was generally used except for the wi’s and 
η in M5, M6, M7 and M8 and for αγ (S2) in M9, M10, M11 
and M12. MCMC sampling of these parameters required 
a random walk Metropolis–Hastings step because their 
full  conditional  posterior  distributions  were  unrecog-
nizable  (see  Cardoso  and  Tempelman  [10]  for  further 
details).

Monte  Carlo  Markov  chain  (MCMC)  based  infer-
ences were implemented using the INTERGEN software 
[29] by saving every 10th cycle from a total of 1,000,000 
cycles,  after  100,000  cycles  of  burn-in.  Global  conver-
gence  was  checked  using  Geweke’s  Z  criterion  [30] 
applied  to  the  conditional  distribution  of  the  data,  as 
proposed by Brooks and Roberts [31]. In addition, visual 
inspection of trace plots was conducted, and a minimum 
effective sample size of 100 for all unknown parameters

Model comparison
The  deviance  information  criterion  (DIC)  was  used  to 
compare model fit and model complexity [32]:

DIC = D(θ) + pD = 2D(θ) − D(θ),

(14)
where D(θ) = Eθ|y[D(θ)] is the posterior expectation of 
Bayesian deviance; pD = D(θ) − D(θ) corresponds to the 
penalty for increasing model complexity, with θ being the 
vector  of  model  parameters  and  D( ¯θ )  being  the  Bayes-
ian deviance as a function of the posterior mean of the 
parameters. Smaller values of DIC thereby indicate bet-
ter-fitting models, while taking a penalty for model com-
plexity into consideration.

Variance components and genetic parameters
The additive genetic variance of TC for a specific envi-
ronment i with effect wi was obtained as follows:

σ2

a |wi = var(cid:31)aj + bjwi(cid:30) = σ2

Thus, the heritability (ha

Estimated breeding values
An  estimate  of  the  breeding  value  of  sire  j  for  TC, 
specific  to  a  given  environment  i  was  obtained  by 

ˆgj| ˆwi = (cid:31)aj + (cid:31)bj(cid:31)wi  [10].  On  the  one  hand,  estimates  of 

ˆbj close to 0 indicate that ĝj is relatively constant across 
various  environments  (ŵi)  such  that  sire  j  has  an  envi-
ronmentally robust genetic merit. On the other hand, an 
environmentally sensitive genetic merit has a large esti-
mate  ˆbj,  meaning  its  relative  performance  should  sub-
stantially change on the environmental gradient [33].

The  sire  breeding  value  estimates  were  compared 
based on the ranking of the animals obtained by AM and 
HBRNM for low, medium and high environmental levels. 
These values were defined by the 10, 50 and 90th percen-
tiles for ŵi. Potential differences in re-rankings of sires for 
selection based on these models were also determined by 
the  Spearman  correlation  between  estimated  breeding 
values. Spearman correlations were obtained for all ani-
mals and for the top 10 % (60) of sires with 12 or more 
progeny between low, medium and high environmental 
levels under different fitted models.

Results and discussion
Model comparison
Models M1, M5 and M9, which were the only models that 
did  not  include  G*E  interactions  with  a  linear  reaction 
norm model, along with M7, and M1, had the highest or 
lowest DIC values. Comparison of DIC between models 
M1, M5 and/or M9 implies that considering heterogene-
ity of residual variance across environments is important 
for modeling LTTC. However, these DIC improvements 
from  homoscedastic  to  heteroscedastic  residual  models 
were small compared to the improvements in DIC when 
going from regular animal to linear reaction norm mod-
els. This suggests that modeling G*E interactions is more 
important  than  modeling  heterogeneous  residual  vari-
ances (Table 2).

The two one-step reaction norm models (M4 and M12) 
had  lower  DIC  values  than  the  corresponding  two-step 
reaction  norm  models,  except  for  M10.  Thus,  treating 
all CG effects as uncertain when modeling G*E interac-
tions  based  on  reaction  norms  seems  to  be  important. 
This observation is in agreement with the findings of Su 
et al. [17], who demonstrated by simulation that jointly 
estimating all unknown parameters is more reliable than 
using  previously  estimated  environmental  effects  from 
a  simple  animal  model  as  known  covariates.  DIC  can 
be used to compare any type of model (not necessarily 
nested  models)  [10,  13,  22,  23].  However,  when  fitting 
two-step models, the reported DIC values come from the 

Mota et al. Genet Sel Evol  (2016) 48:3

second step because we could not account for the uncer-
tainty about ŵi estimates from the first step model M1. 
This limitation might have yielded downwards-biased pD 
and DIC values for two-step models, but even so, their 
fit was much poorer compared to their counterpart one-
step models (Table 2).

Model M12 had the lowest DIC value (Table 2). Recall 
that  M12  allows  for  residual  variance  groupings  into 
decile-based  subclasses,  which  agrees  with  the  findings 
of Cardoso and Tempelman [10], who reported this same 
model as the best-fitting in the characterization of post-
weaning gain in Angus cattle.

Inferences on contemporary group effects
Model  M1  estimated  that  CG  posterior  means  (ŵi) 
ranged  from  −0.849  to  0.805,  which  were  considered 
fixed  covariates  for  models  M2,  M6  and  M10  (Fig.  2). 
Going from the 0–1st to the 9–10th deciles, correspond-
ing values of ŵi were equal to −0.424, −0.224, −0.121, 
−0.032, 0.032, 0.107, 0.182, 0.240 and 0.316, respectively. 
Following  Cardoso  and  Tempelman  [10],  these  val-
ues were used as the cutoff points for the decile-based 

heteroscedastic residual subclasses defined in M9, M10, 
M11 and M12.

Posterior  means  ŵi  of  wi  were  similar  for  all  models, 
regardless of whether G*E interactions were considered, 
as in M3, M4, M7, M8, M11 and M12, or not, as in M1 and 
M9 (Fig. 2); Pearson correlations among these estimates 
between  methods  always  exceeded  0.99,  which  means 
they  were  also  not  influenced  by  homoscedastic  versus 
heteroscedastic residual modeling. These results do not 
agree with Cardoso and Tempelman [10] for post-wean-
ing gain in Angus cattle, for which estimates ŵi from the 
model  with  the  decile-based  heteroscedastic  classifica-
tion  function  (S2)  had  substantially  lower  correlations 
with  estimates  from  the  heteroscedastic  exponential 
function  models  (S1),  or  even  the  conventional  animal 
models.  Furthermore,  every  model  resulted  in  negative 
skewness on the ŵi, ranging from −0.521 to −0.415.
Inferences on variance components and genetic 
parameters

2) were also significant (ranging from 
with σb
0.015  to  0.084).  These  results  show  that  the  one-step 
approach  confirmed  the  presence  of  G*E  interactions. 
Biegelmeyer  [20],  in  a  study  on  tick  resistance  in  Her-
eford and Braford beef cattle reported similar estimates, 
i.e., 0.012 and 0.022 for σa

2, respectively.

Estimates  of  the  correlation  between  intercept  and 
slope  for  the  additive  genetic  and  permanent  environ-
ment effects were characterized by a great deal of uncer-
tainty,  as  shown  by  the  widths  of  their  respective  95  % 
posterior  probability  interval  (PPI;  Table  3).  This  large 
uncertainty  differs  from  those  of  previous  studies  [10, 
25, 34], which estimated large and positive correlations. 
These differences may in part be caused by the fact that 
the correlation estimates depend upon the scale used for 
ŵi or because the biological nature of tick counts is differ-
ent from that of production traits.
2)  were  similar  among 
Residual  variance  estimates  (σe
models,  ranging  from  0.062  ±  0.001  to  0.074  ±  0.010, 
but they were slightly higher in traditional animal mod-
els  M1  (0.072  ±  0.001),  M5  (0.070  ±  0.001)  and  M9 
(0.074 ± 0.010), which confirms the importance of con-
sidering G*E interactions in genetic evaluations for Her-
eford  and  Braford  beef  cattle  (Table  3).  Cardoso  and 
Tempelman  [10]  also  reported  that  HBRNM  resulted 
2 than AM. However, despite the 
in lower estimates of σe
similarity  of  the  residual  variances  across  the  various 
reaction norm models, Fig. 3 illustrates the need to con-
sider residual heteroscedasticity. The first decile class was 
particularly  deviant  from  the  other  classes.  This  unex-
pected, very large residual variance at the lowest extreme 
of the CG effects boundary may be due to data artifacts 
or a non-obvious biological condition associated with low 

tick infestation levels. Similar results were demonstrated 
by Cardoso and Tempelman [10], with residual variances 
being  remarkably  decreased  at  the  extremes  of  the  CG 
average performance. Figure 3 also explains the poor fit of 
models M5, M6, M7 and M8, which modeled heteroscedas-
tic residual variance as an exponential function (i.e., S1). 
This function forced a gradual monotonic change in the 
residual variances over the CG classes, while M9, M10, M11 
and M12 showed a more flexible pattern, perhaps reflect-
ing the true residual variance behavior of the actual data.

Heritability  estimates  (ˆh2)  were  generally  higher 
for  HBRNM  and  for  M5  and  M9,  compared  to  M1 
(ˆh2 = 0.19 ± 0.04; Fig. 4a). Similar heritability estimates 
have been reported in the literature, using models such 
as  M1  and  logarithmic  transformations  of  the  observed 
data [1, 5]. With M12, average heritability estimates were 
higher,  which  also  indirectly  indicates  the  better  fit  of 
one-step  versus  two-step  models  that  consider  residual 
heteroscedasticity. Other studies in beef cattle also found 
higher average heritability estimates for weaning weight 
and  450-day  weight,  respectively,  using  HBRNM  com-
pared  to  AM  [10,  35].  Therefore,  greater  response  to 
selection is expected when using reaction norm models 
that model heterogeneity of residual variances across CG. 
Considering that using data from animals with unknown 
sires could lead to lower heritability estimates, we found 
that our heritability estimates were similar to those previ-
ously reported in the literature [1, 5, 20, 35].

Estimates of repeatability varied along the environmen-
tal gradient (ranging from 0.18 to 0.45) and were, in gen-
eral, higher under high levels of tick infestation (Fig. 4b). 
These  results  demonstrate  the  particular  importance 
of  modeling  permanent  environmental  effects  in  harsh 
environments,  where  more  resistant  animals  are  more 
likely to maintain a consistent performance.

Posterior  means  of  the  genetic  correlations  [see 
Eq. (19)] between breeding values along the environmen-
tal  gradients  for  Hereford  and  Braford  LTTC  that  were 
obtained  by  the  best-fitting  model  M12  demonstrated  a 
large plateau above 0.80 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, estimated 
genetic correlations decreased as the tick infestation level 
increased,  with  negative  correlations  between  extreme 
environmental  levels,  i.e.,  between  more  favorable  (low 
infestation)  and  harsh  environments  (high  infestation). 
Similar  results  that  demonstrate  differences  in  genetic 
correlations between breeding values along environmen-
tal levels, mainly between high challenge conditions and 
favorable  environments,  have  been  reported  in  the  lit-
erature [10, 13, 25]. However, Ambrosini [36] estimated

small differences for Nellore yearling weight, with genetic 
correlations between breeding values along the environ-
mental gradient ranging from 0.78 to 1.00.

Inferences on genetic merit
A  low  genetic  correlation  between  breeding  values  in 
extreme infestation environments (Fig. 5) could indicate 
that different animals would be selected when using the 
reaction  norm  model  M12.  However,  Spearman  rank 
correlations among genetic values obtained by different 
models  were  always  higher  than  0.85  (Table  4),  which 
indicates that rankings of animals would be similar and, 
thus, substantial losses on selection precision might not 
be observed when using a traditional animal model.

Conclusions
Hierarchical  Bayesian  reaction  norm  models  can  be 
used  to  describe  the  presence  of  genotype  by  environ-
ment  interactions  for  tick  resistance  in  Hereford  and 
Braford beef cattle. The model that best fitted tick counts 
in Brazilian climates was a one-step model that consid-
ered heteroscedastic residual variance based on ten dis-
crete classes of deciles of average CG performance (M12), 
and hence, this model should be considered as the pre-
ferred  model  for  genetic  evaluation  of  this  population. 
However, other functions on residual variance and other 
classes of models can be evaluated as viable approaches. 
Reaction  norm  models  are  a  powerful  tool  to  identify 
and quantify genotype by environment interactions and 
present a promising alternative for genetic evaluation of 

tick resistance, since they are expected to lead to greater 
selection efficiency and genetic progress.
