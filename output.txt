Abstract
Background: Pre-clinical models that effectively recapitulate human disease are critical for expanding our knowledge 
of cancer biology and drug resistance mechanisms. For haematological malignancies, the non-obese diabetic/severe 
combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mouse is one of the most successful models to study paediatric acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, for this model to be effective for studying engraftment and therapy 
responses at the whole genome level, careful molecular characterisation is essential.
Results: Here, we sought to validate species-specific gene expression profiling in the high engraftment continuous 
ALL NOD/SCID xenograft. Using the human Affymetrix whole transcript platform we analysed transcriptional profiles 
from engrafted tissues without prior cell separation of mouse cells and found it to return highly reproducible profiles in 
xenografts from individual mice. The model was further tested with experimental mixtures of human and mouse cells, 
demonstrating that the presence of mouse cells does not significantly skew expression profiles when xenografts 
contain 90% or more human cells. In addition, we present a novel in silico and experimental masking approach to 
identify probes and transcript clusters susceptible to cross-species hybridisation.
Conclusions: We demonstrate species-specific transcriptional profiles can be obtained from xenografts when high 
levels of engraftment are achieved or with the application of transcript cluster masks. Importantly, this masking 
approach can be applied and adapted to other xenograft models where human tissue infiltration is lower. This model 
provides a powerful platform for identifying genes and pathways associated with ALL disease progression and 
response to therapy in vivo.

Background
Understanding the complex molecular pathways leading
to  disease  is  critical  for  the  development  of  effective
treatment  regimes  and  novel  drug  targets.  Due  to
research and resource limitations associated with the use
of  primary  patient  material,  pre-clinical  models  are
essential to expand our knowledge of cancer biology and
for the evaluation of new drugs. For pre-clinical testing,
cell lines cultured in vitro have been extensively used but
their  ability  to  recapitulate  primary  disease  is  limited.
Therefore,  more  relevant  disease  models  are  of  critical
importance.

An ideal model would mimic the proliferation and dis-
semination of cancer cells that occur in vivo and behave
in  a  similar  manner  in  response  to  chemotherapeutic
drug  treatment.  The  non-obese  diabetic/severe  com-
bined  immunodeficient  (NOD/SCID)  xenograft  mouse
model is currently one of the most successful models with
which  to  study  haematological  malignancies  such  as
acute 
leukaemia  (ALL)  [1],  whereby
patient bone marrow leukaemia cells are directly trans-
planted into recipient NOD/SCID mice [2]. The kinetics
of  engraftment  reflects  the  human  disease,  leading  to
bone marrow (BM) infiltration, followed by migration to
the  spleen,  peripheral  blood  and  other  haematopoietic
organs [2-4].

For  ALL,  although  cure  rates  are  exceeding  75%,  the
development of drug resistance is poorly understood and
remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chil-
dren  [5].  Importantly,  much  of  our  knowledge  of  the
mechanisms underlying drug resistance has been gener-
ated  in  vitro  using  immortalised  cancer  cell  lines.  The
extent  to which  cell  lines retain features of the  original
disease in vivo is a matter of debate [6]. Thus relevant in
vivo, pre-clinical models that recapitulate human disease
are  critical  to  delineate  resistance  mechanisms  and
improve survival.

Primary  leukaemia  cells  engrafted  into  NOD/SCID
mice appear to retain many of the phenotypic and geno-
typic  features  of  the  original  specimen  [2,7-10].  More-
over,  their  drug  resistance  profile  to  conventional
chemotherapeutics  mirrors  that  of  the  patient  clinical
response  [2,10].  Importantly,  comparisons  have  shown
that such xenografts more closely resemble their tumour
type of origin than in vitro cell lines and have been accu-
rate in predicting efficacious drug combinations and clin-
ically active therapeutics [11-14].

Continuous  xenografts  can  be  established  by  trans-
planting cells harvested from the spleen of engrafted ani-
mals  into  secondary  and  tertiary  recipient  mice  [10].
Utilising  continuous  ALL  NOD/SCID  xenografts  the
effects  of  chemotherapy  drugs  can  be  assessed  at  the
molecular level. Thus, the aim of the current study was to
characterise gene expression profiling in the continuous
ALL xenograft so that it can be used as a model for the
development of therapy resistance in vivo. We have previ-
ously demonstrated the clinical relevance of gene-expres-
sion  profiling  through  the  successful  identification  of
markers predictive of ALL disease outcome, drug-resis-
tance  and  relapse  in  a  number  of  primary  ALL  patient
cohorts [15-21]. However, to validate the xenograft model
system  for  transcriptional  analysis  three  critical  issues
needed to be addressed. Firstly, we needed to determine
the most appropriate engrafted xenograft tissue for analy-
sis. BM is more commonly isolated from patients, how-
ever, the spleen in xenograft mice contains at least seven-
fold more leukaemia cells, which makes isolation of these
cells more practical for analysis. Thus, we were interested
in establishing whether the same gene expression profiles
can be obtained from engrafted spleen and BM. Secondly,
we wanted to address the reproducibility of the engraft-
ment  in  both  the  BM  and  spleen  of  independent  mice.
Phenotypic evidence suggests engraftment in the contin-
uous mouse model is reproducible [10], however, this has
not  been  examined  at  the  transcriptional  level.  Finally,
when  testing  the  expression  of  human  xenografts  we
wanted to measure the effect of the host murine tissue.
Studies from other xenograft models have demonstrated
cross-species hybridisation of mouse RNA to human spe-
cific microarrays. Although not extensively characterised,

such studies suggest the potential skewing of human gene
expression  profiles  [22-26].  The  previous  studies  were
performed using Affymetrix expression arrays designed
to  target  the  3'  end  of  the  gene.  This  region  shows  the
most divergence between mouse and human. To date, the
extent of cross hybridisation using the Affymetrix whole
transcript  Human  Gene  1.0  ST  array  has  not  been
assessed. The goal of the present study was therefore to
validate the use of gene expression profiling in the ALL
NOD/SCID xenograft model so that it can be used as a
pre-clinical model of relapse.

Results
Comparison of BM/spleen transcriptional profiles of ALL 
xenografts
Our previous studies have demonstrated that there are no
morphological differences in ALL cells engrafted to the
BM or spleen of NOD/SCID mouse xenografts [2]. Weared to carriage
isolates (1.5%; 11 out of 741, p,0.0001, Table 1). Approximately
50% of the carriage isolates were unencapsulated (non-groupable),
and the presence/absence of IS1301 in the IGR should not affect
the phenotype of these isolates. To exclude this as a potential
confounding factor, we restricted our analysis to serogroupable
isolates. There was still a significant difference for the presence of
IS1301 in the IGR in disease (31 out of 336) compared to carriage
isolates
(11 out of 365, p = 0.0004) even after excluding
unencapsulated isolates.

Insertion of IS1301 was most frequently found in MenB isolates
belonging to clonal complex ST-269 (cc269) with 24 of 55 having
IS1301 in the IGR (Table 2). Cc269 causes a significant
proportion of meningococcal cases in UK [16,19], and in the
collection, cc269 isolates were more commonly found among
disease isolates (16%; 55 out of 345) compared to carriage isolates
(3%; 22 out of 741, p,0.0001). To account for this potential bias,
we analysed only cc269 isolates, and still
found a significant
difference between the presence of IS1301 in the IGR of disease
isolates (44%; 24 out of 55) compared to carriage isolates (14%; 3
out of 22, p = 0.017).

QS-independent gene trpD (P.0.2)
(Figure 2). It is of course
possible that azithromycin inhibited the expression of some other
genes unrelated to QS. However microarray data have shown that

QS-regulated genes were among those whose expression was most
severely affected by azithromycin [16].

We determined the evolution of P. aeruginosa QS in patients by
first measuring the production of elastase, which is under the
control of the lasR QS-system [17] from the 650 collected isolates
(data not shown). Variations in elastase activity correlated with
mutations in lasR between independent wild type and mutant lasR
alleles (Mann-Whitney: P,0.001), as determined by sequencing

increased through time in the 31 control group patients
(Figure 3a;
there
was a small, decline in the proportion of lasR mutants in the 30
azithromycin treated patients (Figure 3a; F1,10 = 32.58, P,0.001;
test of whether slopes differ (treatment by time interaction) in full
model: F1, 20 = 77.6; P,0.001). In agreement with this observa-
tion,
isolates from placebo patients showed decreasing mean
elastase levels in vitro (Figure 3b; F1,10 = 41.12, P,0.001), while
isolates from the azithromycin treated group showed a concom-
itant increase through time (Figure 3b; F1,10 = 41.12, P,0.001;
treatment by time interaction in full model: F1,20 = 26.46,
P,0.001).

logistic regression: F1,10 = 65.36, P,0.001),

These data are consistent with the hypothesis that azithromycin
treatment removes any advantage of QS-mutants, because QS is
blocked in the wildtype population. There are, however, a number
of alternative explanations, particularly as bacterial densities,
based on mean P. aeruginosa genomic copy numbers, were twice as
large in the placebo compared to the azithromycin group (76106
and 1.26107;
t = 1.96, P = 0.06). First, azithromycin-imposed
reduction in densities could reflect reductions in growth rate,
and this could simply have slowed down the rate at which lasR
mutants change in frequency. We can however rule this out as a
primary explanation for our data, because azithromycin did not
only cause a quantitative change in the frequency of lasR mutants,
but also a qualitative change: lasR mutants decreased in frequency
during azithromycin treatment, whereas they increased in the
placebo group (Figure 3). Second, it is possible that azithromycin
may reduce selection for lasR mutants if reductions in QS-
mediated public goods production results from reductions in
bacterial density caused by azithromycin. Third, azithromycin
lasR mutants more than
may directly inhibit
wildtype bacteria, explaining why there was a small reduction in
the frequency of lasR mutants following azithromycin treatment.
We address these possibilities below. Furthermore we cannot
exclude that azithromycin influenced the structure of the resident
bacterial flora of the patients which could in turn influence the P.
aeruginosa population and its virulence properties [18].

the growth of

QS-inhibition in vitro

To aid the interpretation of the clinical data, we carried out in
vitro experiments with wild type P. aeruginosa (PAO1) and an
isogenic lasR mutant in the presence and absence of azithromycin.
Danesi et al. [19] measured azithromycin concentrations of 9 mg/
kg in lung tissue of patients receiving a comparable dosing regimen
as those in our study, hence we used similar concentrations (5 and
10 mg/l) for our in vitro experiments. We first measured growth
rates in media where the primary nutrient source is protein (BSA),
making lasR-controlled expression of proteases necessary for the
production of useable amino acids [6].

Consistent with previous studies [6], growth rate of the lasR
mutant in monoculture was reduced relative to the wildtype (by

These results indicate that the presence of <10% mouse
cells does not significantly skew human gene expression
signatures. Importantly, other xenograft models show dif-
ferent levels of mouse cells in engrafted tissue and there-
fore  may  require  a  masking  approach  to  control  cross-
species hybridisation. We tested this using two comple-
mentary masking approaches.

Masking cross species hybridisation
We  first  tested  the  hybridisation  of  pure  mouse  non-
engrafted spleen (NES) to human arrays (Figure 3). We
found that the overall raw signal intensity and signal to
noise ratio (SNR) of mouse transcripts was significantly
reduced  compared  to  the  hybridisation  of  the  human
samples (signal intensity 115.36-329.47 and SNR 0.7-1.67
respectively).  The  signal  distribution  of  the  hybridising
targets  showed  a  reduced  frequency  for  high  intensity
values for mouse NES compared to ALL.100 (Figure 3). A
small percentage of transcript clusters, however, resulted
in  very  high  signals  for  the  mouse  NES  samples,  these
were  selected  as  candidates  for  the  masking  approach
(Figure 4). Taking the top 1% of normalised mean signal
expression  we  identified  312  transcript  clusters  with  a

4B) (Additional file 2).

We then identified transcript clusters theoretically sus-
ceptible to cross-species hybridisation due to their asso-
ciated probes having high identity to mouse transcripts.
We identified 75,300 probes, which matched the mouse
genome with 100% identity and/or with a single base mis-
match. Of the 28,869 human transcript clusters targeted
by  the  Human  Gene  ST  1.0  array  our  filtering  method
revealed 1,085 (~3.75%) transcript clusters as candidates
susceptible to cross-species hybridisation (Additional file
2).

Of the 312 experimentally derived transcript clusters,
117  (37.5%)  were  also  identified  using  the  in  silico
approach,  highlighting  a  degree  of  overlap  between  the
two  approaches.  Both  the  experimental  and  in  silico
masking  approaches  were  combined  resulting  in  1280
(4.4%)  transcript  clusters  to  be  masked  from  the  total
gene expression signals (Additional file 2). The combined
masking approach was applied to ALL.90 and compared
to the ranked signal intensity of ALL.100 (Figure 5). Fol-
lowing application of the combined mask, calculation of
the mean squared distance (MSD) between ALL.100 and
ALL.90  revealed  a  decrease  in  variability  (MSD  =
2.259019e-06-8.978447e-07 respectively). Using MvA plots
we applied each of the in silico, experimental and com-
bined masking approaches to the ALL.100 versus ALL.90
comparison  (Figure  6).  Application  of  the  combined
approach removed several of the outliers and thus vari-
ability enabling us to reduce cross-species hybridisation
and  improve  concordance  between  the  ALL.100  and
ALL.90 transcriptional profiles.

Discussion
The  current  study  sought  to  address  the  sensitivity  of
gene expression profiling for human xenografts growing
in mice without prior cell separation. Mouse cells, pres-
ent in xenografts can be separated using lengthy deple-
tion  protocols  and  fluorescent  activated  cell  sorting
(FACS) which can have deleterious affects on transcrip-

tional  profiles.  Several  studies,  using  a  variety  of  xeno-
graft  mouse  models,  have  previously  examined  cross-
species  hybridisation  without  prior  cell  separation  [22-
26].  These  studies  were  performed  using  Affymetrix
expression arrays designed to target the 3' end of genes.
The  3'  expression  arrays  are  thought  to  be  relatively
insensitive  to  cross-species  hybridisation  as  there  is
greater  than  10%  DNA  divergence  between  mouse  and
human within the 3' untranslated region (UTR). In con-
trast,  the  Human  gene  1.0  ST  array  queries  the  whole
transcript,  giving  a  more  accurate  reflection  of  gene
expression.  Using  the  whole  transcript  platform,  our
results  show  that  mouse  cells  do  not  significantly  skew
cancer expression profiles when xenografts contain 90%
or more human cells. Although mouse RNA was found to
cross-hybridise  to  the  whole  transcript  arrays  in  the
absence of human target, when tested in the presence of
human  RNA  (>  90%),  the  effect  on  the  transcriptional
profiles was minimal. Our microarray analysis and theo-
retical modelling indicated that the design of the whole
transcript  Affymetrix  chips  is  effective  enough  to  limit
aberrant cross-hybridising mouse RNA. Therefore, with-
out  prior  cell  separation,  profiling  xenografts  on  whole
transcript arrays is possible for high engraftment haema-
tological models.

We developed experimental and in silico derived gene
sets  to  mask  probes  and  transcript  clusters  potentially
susceptible to cross-species hybridisation. Application of
the transcript cluster masks to the gene expression pro-
files  of  the  human/mouse  graded  mixtures,  improved
results  by  removing  outliers  and  reducing  variability.
While  the  derived  masking  approaches  outlined  in  this
study were used for a high engraftment model, this mask-
ing approach could be applied and adapted to other xeno-
graft  model  systems  where  human  tissue  infiltration  is
below 90%.

The  kinetics  of  engraftment  in  the  NOD/SCID  ALL
xenograft model reflect the human disease with BM infil-
tration,  followed  by  migration  to  the  spleen,  peripheral
blood  and  other  haematopoietic  organs  [2-4].  Impor-

tantly, our findings suggest that spleen is a practical alter-
native  to  BM  for  profiling  xenograft  tissue.  Microarray

scriptional signatures of engrafted BM and spleen. More-
over,  we  determined  that  the  process  of  leukaemia

Conclusions
Characterisation of reliable pre-clinical models to iden-
tify the most promising new agents to enter clinical trials

and  molecular  events  underlying  drug  resistance  is  of
critical  importance.  For  childhood  cancers,  xenograft
models  have  been  particularly  accurate  in  identifying
clinically active agents and effective drug combinations.
The  continuous  NOD/SCID  xenograft  model  for  ALL
provides  a  powerful  platform  with  which  to  study  and
monitor drug resistance phenotypes in vivo. In this report
we have evaluated the accuracy of molecular signatures
derived  from  xenografts.  We  demonstrate  that  species-
specific  transcriptional  profiles  can  be  obtained  from
xenografts when high levels of engraftment are achieved

entricular failure. A non-significant reduction in PVR
Index after liver injury has been described [20]. The rea-
son for this difference is unclear. Acute lung injury is
common in patients with acetaminophen-induced fulmi-
nant hepatic failure and is associated with systemic cir-
culatory failure, cerebral oedema and high mortality.

The marked reduction in Factor V and VII levels in
the current model were consistent with severe liver
injury. The Clichy criteria [21] deemed a reduction of
Factor V levels to <20-30% as the trigger for liver trans-
plantation; this was the case in most animals in this
experiment. The absence of changes in Factor VIII levels
indicate DIC was not the cause of altered levels of other
coagulation factors.

An increase in AST levels indicated the development of
liver necrosis, although these were not as high as are seen
in patients. Similarly, a rise in bilirubin did not occur. This
may reflect a species-specificity of the assay used, or insuf-
ficient time for bilirubin to rise. It is possible that there are
subtle variations in this model compared to humans in
that some systemic features prevail over a liver focused

pattern of injury. Liver tissue analysis revealed severe coa-
gulative necrosis in some animals with moderate and mild
injury in others. This supports the probability that signifi-
cant liver injury accounts for the clinical syndrome
reported here. Although there is some variability in the
liver injury seen in this model, there is still significant liver
injury in the majority of animals. Indeed, this variation clo-
sely mimics what is seen clinically.

There are several explanations for the failure to observe
changes in ICP. The time course may have been too brief.
However, a raised ICP is not always encountered in the
clinical setting, or only in association with other factors
such as sepsis. It may also reflect differences in the patho-
physiology of drug-induced ALF as opposed to ischaemic
models of ALF. Measurements of arterial ammonia, cere-
bral blood flow or the use of cerebral microdialysis may
help to clarify intracranial effects in future studies. Bio-
chemical analysis suggested that animals may have been
developing encephalopathy, although in the absence of
ICP changes and with general anaesthesia it is difficult to
be certain. Fischerâs ratio [16], the ratio of the aromatic
amino acid (AAA; tyrosine and phenylalanine) to branch
chain amino acid (BCAA; leucine, isoleucine and valine)

Development of a cross-species making approach
To filter cross-species hybridisation we identified all oli-
gonucleotide  probes  on  the  Human  GeneChip  1.0  ST
array  susceptible  to  spurious  signal  from  mouse  RNA
using a coupled bioinformatics, in silico and experimental
masking approach which is detailed below.

Cross-species hybridisation derived in silico
A murine genomic sequence database was compiled from
release  54  of  the  Ensembl  Database  [31].  All  HuGene
array  annotation  files  were  obtained  directly  from  the
Affymetrix website [32]. The probes, probesets and tran-
script clusters from these files annotated as targeting core
human  transcripts  (i.e.  non  Affymetrix  control  probes)
were combined, based on their annotated genomic coor-
dinates, to create a mapping table with a three tier hierar-
chy where probes belong to probesets that in turn belong
to  transcript  clusters  (mapping  table  available  on
request). The nucleotide sequences for each probe on the
HuGene array were obtained from the Affymetrix probe
annotation  file.  The  alignment  tool  BLAT  was  used  to
map  human  probe  sequences  to  the  murine  genome
sequence database. Probes were considered a hit if they
matched a database sequence with 100% identity or with
a single base mismatch. The BLAT parameters were opti-
mised to detect the 25 mer probes [33] with tileSize and
stepSize  set  to  12  and  7  respectively.  An  in  house
designed Perl script was then used in conjunction with
our mapping table to parse the BLAT output files in order
to filter out those transcript clusters containing probesets
with large numbers of hit probes. Transcript clusters with
high numbers of associated hit probes would be deemed
candidates for masking. In this filtering process, probes
were  systematically  removed  from  any  probesets  with
which they were associated. Following this, those probe-
sets with < 50% of their associated probes remaining were
systematically removed from any transcript clusters with
which they were associated. Once â¥ 50% of probesets in a
transcript cluster had been removed the transcript clus-
ter was then selected as a candidate for masking.

Cross-species hybridisation derived experimentally
An  experimental  approach  was  employed  to  examine
cross-hybridisation of mouse mRNA to the Human gene
array in the absence of human RNA. Three independent
non-engrafted mouse spleen (NES) samples were hybri-
dised  to  the  Human  Gene  1.0  ST  array,  CEL  files  were
imported into GeneSpring version GX 10.0.2 and norma-
lised using the Robust Multi-Array (RMA-16) algorithm.
The  mean  signal  intensity  of  the  three  biological  repli-
cates  was  used  to  identify  cross-hybridising  transcript
clusters.

species hybridisation by experimental and in silico masking
