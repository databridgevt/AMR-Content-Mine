Abstract
Background:  Growth  inhibition  by  RPR-130401,  a  non-peptidomimetic  farnesyltransferase
inhibitor, was investigated without or with combined exposure to ionizing radiation in three human
tumor cell lines (HCT-116, MiAPaCa-2 and A-549) bearing a point mutation in the K-Ras gene.
Results: RPR-130401 inhibited cell growth with an IC50 of 50 nM (HCT-116), 120 nM (MiAPaCa-
2) and 710 nM (A-549), with a poor incidence of apoptosis. The drug brought about G1 and S phase
depletion  together  with  arrest  of  cells  in  G2  phase  and  induced  a  significant  accumulation  of
hyperploid cells showing active S phase DNA synthesis, with HCT-116 and A-549 cells being the
most and least responsive, respectively. The drug also produced dramatic changes of the nuclear
lamin B pattern, without lamin B cleavage and perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton. On the other
hand,  RPR-130401  elicited  strictly  additive  interaction  in  combined  treatment  with  ionizing
radiation with regard to cell kill, altered cell cycle progression and induced hyperploidy.
Conclusions:  The  data  suggest  that  disruption  of  orderly  progression  through  mitosis  and
cytokinesis, is a major outcome of drug action and that this effect proceeds from inhibition of lamin
B farnesylation. It is anticipated from the strict additivity of RPR-130401 and radiation that neither
induced  radiation  resistance  nor  acute  or  late  complications  of  radiotherapy,  should  occur  in
combined treatment with RPR-130401.

Background
For over ten years chemo-radiotherapeutic combinations
have evolved as prevalent modalities in the cure of solid
tumors.  The  rationale  for  these  treatments  relies  mostly
on the drugs' ability to sterilize disseminated metastases
(spatial  cooperation)  and  on  radiation-drug  interaction
for improved local control of the primary tumor. Supraad-
ditive interaction, often resulting from impaired repair of

radiation-induced sublethal damage, may lead to limiting
toxicities.  In  contrast,  pure  additivity  of  the  treatments
may conceivably be turned to advantage because the dose-
dependent response of cells to radiation includes a quad-
ratic  term.  This  is  of  concern,  for  example,  to  farnesyl
transferase  inhibitors  (FTIs)  of  which  six  have  already
been tested in phase I clinical trials [1,2] with most atten-
tion being paid to the non-peptidomimetic R115777 [3–

5]. As one may expect a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic
effect from FTIs, assays of combined modality treatment
with cytotoxic agents applied in close temporal proximity
should be performed. This prompted us to investigate the
cells' response to RPR-130401 (Scheme 1), a non-peptid-
omimetic FTI issued from chemical optimization from se-
ries selected by random screening at Rhône-Poulenc-Rorer
Co.  [6],  both  alone  or  in  concomitant  association  with
ionizing radiation.

A comprehensive approach to these problems requires an
insight into the molecular targets of drug action. Together
with  mutation  or  deletion  of  the  p53  tumor  suppressor
gene, mutations in one of the four Ras genes (H-, N-, KA-
and  KB-Ras)  represent  the  most  frequent  genetic  altera-
tions in human cancers [7] with predominance in pancre-
atic (90%), colorectal (50%) and lung (20%) tumors (for
a review on ras mutations in relation to oncogenic trans-
formation see [2]). Activation of Ras proteins requires pre-
nylation  of  the  CAAX  sequence  at  their  C-terminus,  to
ultimately permit their association with other proteins [8]
or with the inner face of the plasma membrane [9]. A key
step  in  this  process  is  catalyzed  by  farnesyltransferase
(FTase). The K-Ras protein can alternatively be prenylated
by type I geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase  I),  a closely
related enzyme [10].

FTase has been a very attractive target for antitumor drug
discovery  because  prenylation  is  required  for  oncogenic
Ras to transform cells [11–13]. Numerous inhibitors have
been  developed,  including  FPP  analogs,  CAAX  peptide
analogs,  bisubstrate  analogs  [14,15]  and  more  recently
GGTase I inhibitors [16]. However, it is now known that
a  range  of  non-Ras  proteins  are  targets  for  prenylation
[17–19]. In spite of this, the quest for specific FTase-target-
ing drugs that would not affect GGTase is still pertinent,
because geranylgeranylation of normal cellular proteins is
five  to  ten  times  more  prevalent  than  farnesylation
[20,21].

RPR-130401  acts  as  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  the  FPP
substrate with respect to the farnesylated proteins, with an
IC50 of 28 nM for the inhibition of K-Ras prenylation in
vitro[6], and has demonstrated in vivo antitumor activity in
mice  bearing  human  carcinoma  xenografts  [22].  RPR-
130401 is highly selective (more than 300-fold) for FTase
with  regards  to GGTase, an  unexpected result  since GG-
Tase can accommodate and transfer both FPP and geran-
ylgeranyl pyrophosphate to CAAX-motifs in proteins [23].
Consistently,  RPR-130401  efficiently  inhibits  Ras  far-
nesylation  in  cells  but  does  not  block  geranylgeranyl
transfer to Ras [24]. RPR-130401 is also very efficient in
inhibiting lamin B farnesylation [6]. The lack of protein
substrate specificity is of particular interest for the devel-
opment of this series of FTIs, as non-Ras farnesylated pro-

teins may participate in transformation by Ras-dependent
or -independent pathways. The discovery of prenylation-
dependent oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatases har-
boring a CAAX-box [25] strengthens the interest for such
FTIs as RPR-130401.

For  studies  with  RPR-130401  we  chose  three  cell  lines
bearing a K-Ras allele with a point mutation, namely, the
human colon adenocarcinoma HCT-116 with mutation at
codon  13  [26],  the  human  pancreatic  carcinoma  MiA-
PaCa-2 with mutation at codon 12 [27], and the human
lung carcinoma A-549 with another mutation at codon 12
[28]. Cell growth or survival, cell cycle progression, ploi-
dy,  lamin  B  structure  in  nuclear  lamina,  cytoskeleton
framework, and lamin B fragmentation were taken as an
endpoint in single or combined treatment with ionizing
radiation. The data show that RPR-130401 affects the in-
tegrity of the lamin B network, resulting in an aberrant on-
set  of  mitosis  and  cytokinesis  and  ensuing  hyperploidy
without significant changes in radiation susceptibility.

Results
Growth inhibition by RPR-130401
The response of HCT-116, A-549 and MiAPaCa-2 cells to
RPR-130401 was investigated through growth inhibition
assays with exponentially growing subcultures. Cells were
exposed to the drug for up to 7-days at concentrations in
the range 2.5–7,000 nM. RPR-130401 was found to inhib-
it cell growth with an IC50 of 50 nM for HCT-116, 120 nM
for MiAPaCa-2 and 710 nM for A-549 cells. The effect cor-
related with a pronounced lengthening of the cells' dou-
bling time (Figure 2).

seeded (2 × 105 cells in 25 cm2 flasks) and incubated for 24-h prior to introduction of RPR-130401. The drug was present for
up  to  the time  of  trypsinization  and  cell  scoring.  RPR-130401 induced  a pronounced  lengthening  of  the cell  doubling  time,
namely, for HCT-116 cells, 23-h (50 nM drug = 1 × IC50) or 30-h (500 nM drug) vs. 18-h in drug-free controls; for A-549 cells,
30-h (0.71 µM drug = 1 × IC50) or 35-h (7.1 µM drug) vs. 22-h in drug-free controls; for MiAPaCa- 2 cells, 35-h (0.12 µM drug
= 1 × IC50) or 40-h (1.2 µM drug) vs. 23-h in drug-free controls.

Altered cell cycle progression by RPR-130401 and radia-
tion
To  investigate  cell  cycle  redistribution  by  RPR-130401,
HCT-116, MiAPaCa-2 and A-549 cells were exposed for 5-
days to 1 × IC50 or 10 × IC50 FTI (relative to the cell line
of interest) and submitted or not to γ-rays 24-h before har-
vest. BrdUrd was incorporated at the end of treatment for
S-phase cell labeling. The three cell lines were not equally
responsive to drug (Figure 3). RPR-130401 induced accu-
mulation of HCT-116 cells in G2-M phase, with a concen-
tration-dependent  increase  in  the  ploidy  number  and  a
decline  in  the  normodiploid  G1-  and  S-phase  content.
These observations correlate those made by other authors
using Ras-mutated human pancreatic cells and L-744,832
[29] or human lung cancer cells and FTI-2153 [30]. MiA-
PaCa-2 cells showed a similar response at low (1 × IC50)
drug concentration. However, with this cell line both the
G1  phase  depletion  and  the  increase  in  the  ploidy
number, were substantially less pronounced at high (10 ×
IC50) than at low (1 × IC50) drug concentration. Finally,
with the exception of the pre-mitotic arrest, the effect of
RPR-130401 on cell cycle progression and ploidy change
was comparatively minor in A-549 cells. Irradiation pro-
moted drug-induced effects. Incidentally, flow cytometric
analysis did not provide evidence of a significant amount
of the sub-G1 DNA fragments expected from apoptosis.

Radiation survival in the presence of RPR-130401
Two  methods  were  used  to  determine  whether  RPR-
130401  resulted  or  not  in  an  altered  radiation  survival.
For  lengths  of  drug  exposure  in  excess  of  12-h  (1-  to  5-
days),  cells  were  trypsinized  and  plated  following  treat-
ment to  preclude  artifacts  due  to  cell multiplicity. Short
contact with drug (1-, 2-, 3- or 12-h) was performed in the
most sensitive cell line only, i.e., in HCT-116 cells. In that
case, cells were plated prior to treatment and the data cor-
rected for changes in cell multiplicity (see Materials and
Methods)  where  necessary.  A  total  of  78  survival  curves
were  generated  and  fitted  to  eq.  (2)  (see  Materials  and
Methods)  for  data  analysis.  Irrespective  of  the  method
used,  exposure  of  cells  to  RPR-130401  did  not  produce
any significant modification of radiation sensitivity rela-
tive to controls, even with the largest drug concentration
and the longest length of drug exposure (Figure 4).

Effects of RPR-130401 on lamin B distribution
Altered distribution of lamin B following exposure to the
FTI was investigated in  HCT-116,  A-549 and MiaPaCa-2
cells. Cells were exposed for 5-days to 1 × IC50 or 10 × IC50
RPR-103401, submitted or not to γ-rays 24-h before har-
vest  and  lamin  B  was  subsequently  probed  by  immun-
ofluorescence. Typical results are shown in Figure 5.

Control cells (Figure 5A,5D & 5G) showed a nuclear dis-
tribution of lamin B with localization to the nuclear lam-

the dose indicated and allowed to rest in the incubator for an
additional  24-h  prior  to  harvest.  The  DNA  content  was
determined  from  flow  cytometric  analysis  of  propidium
iodide  staining  and  BrdUrd  incorporation.  104  nuclei  were

RPR-130401. Cells were plated, exposed to the drug for 3-days and irradiated. Each flask was trypsinized immediately after
irradiation and 800 to 1,000 cells were replated in drug-free medium for colony formation assays. To account for the loss of
plating efficiency du to drug exposure, survival values were normalized relative to the surviving fraction for drug alone. The
curves were drawn for best fit to a linear quadratic equation (eq. (2), see Materials and Method) taking all data points into con-
sideration. Found: α = 0.518 ± 0.036 Gy-1, β = 0.044 ± 0.016 Gy-2 for HCT-116 cells; α = 0.193 ± 0.036 Gy-1, β = 0.065 ±
0.014 Gy-2 for A-549 cells; α = 0.189 ± 0.058 Gy-1, β = 0.086 ± 0.026 Gy-2 for MiAPaCa-2 cells. Each data point came from an
average over three flasks or more. Bars, SD. The figure at bottom right shows the surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) of HCT-116

ina  as  indicated  by  a  ring-like  staining  at  the  nuclear
periphery. During mitosis the lamin was either cytoplas-
mic (Figure 5D) or poorly detectable (Figure 5G,5H). The
pattern of lamin B distribution was markedly altered fol-
lowing  incubation  with  RPR-130401,  depending  on  the
cell  line.  For  HCT-116  (Figure  5B,5C)  and  A-549  cells
(Figure 5E,5F), the lamin B staining was still nuclear with
the characteristic ring-like structure but, in addition to gi-
ant  nuclei  typical  of  treated  HCT-116  cells  (Figure  5C),
cell  doublets  with  no  proper  separation  of the  daugther
nuclei  after  telophase  were  observed  (Figure  5F).  MiA-
PaCa-2  cells  showed  a  different  pattern  in  response  to
RPR-130401  (Figure  5H,5H’).  With  these  cells,  lamin  B

was not strictly confined in the nucleus as indicated by cy-
toplasmic  patches  (Figure  5H).  Examination  of  DAPI-
stained  nuclei  confirmed  the  absence  of  DNA  in  these
patches (Figure 5H’). Lamin B figures were not apprecia-
bly modified by exposure to ionizing radiation; however,
radiation  induced  the  formation  of  micronuclei  in  rela-
tion to mitotic cell death (data not shown).

tor trafficking,  has  recently  been  suggested  as an impor-
tant  mediator  of  the  antineoplastic  potential  of  FTIs
[19,32]. We therefore sought to investigate the effects of
50 nM or 500 nM RPR-130401 on the distribution of actin
and tubulin networks in HCT-116-cells exposed to RPR-
130401  and/or  radiation.  Pictures  obtained  using  rhod-
amine-phalloidin and immunofluorescent labeling of iso-
thiocyanate-conjugated  tubulin  in  control  and  treated
cells, are shown in Figure 6.

L-739,749, another FTI, was earlier shown to induce rapid
morphological  reversion  of  rat  fibroblasts  (Rat1-ras)
transformed  with H-ras [33].  Such phenotypic reversion

was  not  observed  using  RPR-130401  in  HCT-116  cells.
Normal membrane ruffles, circumferential actin bundles
and focal adhesions as seen in control HCT-116 cells (Fig-
ure 6A), were still present in cells incubated for as long as
5-days  in  the  presence  of  RPR-130401  (Figure  6B).  The
size  of the nuclei and  the  number  of giant  cells  grew  in
parallel in the presence of the drug, up to threefold rela-
tive to controls. The stress fibers and the tubulin network
were normal in these cells (Figure 6B & 6D). Examination
of bisbenzimide-stained nuclei showed the absence of ap-
optotic  bodies  (Figure  6A’,6B’),  and  no  vesicles  were
formed in the cytoplasm of treated cells.

were grown on coverslips for 5-days without or with 500 nM RPR-130401. The cells were subsequently given 3.5 Gy γ-rays
and allowed to rest in the incubator for 24-h. Cells were then fixed and incubated with TRITC-labeled phalloidin (A, B), or with
an anti-α tubulin FTIC-conjugated antibody (C, D). Nuclei were counter-stained with bisbenzimide (A', B'). Cells were viewed
as in Figure 5. The bar (C) represents 20 µm.

RPR-130401-induced modification of the HCT-116 karyo-
type
Activation  of  Ha-ras  gene  expression  in  mouse  NIH3T3
cells is known to result in genomic instability, identified
from  chromosome  aberrations  including  acentric  frag-
ments,  multicentric  and  double-minute  chromosomes
[34,35]. We therefore investigated the effects of 50 nM or
500 nM RPR-130401 on the ploidy and chromosome in-
tegrity  in  HCT-116-cells  exposed  to  RPR-130401  and/or
radiation. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the chromo-
some  score  within  individual  metaphases  of  colcemid-
treated cells after 1-day of contact with RPR-130401. Con-
trol cells showed a near-diploid karyotype with a modal
number  of chromosomes  of  45.  Excess ploidy increased
with the drug concentration,  the  radiation  dose and  the
length of drug exposure. The mitotic index decreased dur-
ing treatment (data not shown), thus confirming that the
accumulation of HCT-116 cells was in the G2 phase.

However,  no  chromosome  aberration  was  seen  at  this
stage  using  FISH  analysis  with  all  human  centromeres
probes.  All  chromosomes  in  the  metaphases  examined
displayed  one  unique  centromere,  even  in  metaphases
containing up to 200 chromosomes (data not shown).

Western blot analysis of lamin B in treated cells
Flow cytometry (Figure 3) and DAPI fluorescence of nu-
clei (Figure 5),  did not provide evidence of a significant
level  of  apoptosis  in  cells  exposed  to  RPR-130401.  In
some instances, however, the pictures obtained from im-
munofluorescence analysis of the lamin B status in cells ex-
posed for 5-days to RPR-130401, suggested breakdown of
nuclear lamina, and it has been shown recently that inhi-
bition  of  protein  prenylation  may  cause  apoptotic  cell
death in pancreatic cells [36]. As lamin B cleavage into 46
kDa  fragments  is  a  hallmark  of  apoptosis  [37],  we  per-
formed a Western blot determination of lamin B in extracts
from HCT-116, A-549 and MiAPaCa-2 cells exposed for 5-
days to 10 × IC50 RPR-130401. The results (Figure 8) un-
ambiguously show complete absence of lamin B cleavage.

Discussion
The main effects  of RPR-130401  against the three  K-Ras
mutated  cell  lines  used  in  this  study  were  (i)  a  pro-
nounced cytostatic effect, with an IC50 in the range 50–
710 nM; (ii) accumulation of cells in G2 phase, with G1
and S phase depletion; (iii) induction of a large amount
of  hyperploid cells  (HCT-116 and  MiAPaCa-2) showing
active  S-phase  DNA  synthesis,  together  with  some  giant
cells; (iv) profound alteration of the lamin B pattern, with-
out cleavage of the protein; (v) no alteration of the micro-

tubule  and  actin  networks,  even  after  prolonged
incubation  with  a  high  drug  concentration  in  the  most
sensitive cell line (500 nM, HCT-116 cells); (vi) strictly ad-
ditive  interaction  with  ionizing  radiation  with  regard  to
cell kill, cell cycle redistribution and induction of hyper-
ploidy.

Two alternative pathways should be taken into considera-
tion in order to explain these observations, namely, inhi-
bition  of  the  farnesylation  of  p21Ras  or  related  proteins
from the Ras superfamily, or inhibition of the farnesyla-
tion of other proteins resulting in disruption of the mitot-
ic apparatus or cytokinesis traverse. These hypotheses are
discussed below.

p21Ras activation in normal and tumor cells is mandatory
to  the  transition  from  cell  quiescence  to  proliferation.
However, it is generally agreed that inhibition of p21Ras
farnesylation  does  not  suppress  mitogenic  functions  in
Ras-transformed cells [38]. Moreover, it has recently been
shown that growth inhibition by FTIs does not necessarily
proceed from inhibition of p21Ras prenylation, and that
various Ras-unrelated proteins may be important targets
for FTI treatment [2,19,29,39,40]. Even though it results

in  an  altered  subcellular  distribution  of  p21Ras[6],  RPR-
130401  is  not  able  to  block  p21Ras  geranylgeranylation
[24] in such a way that inhibition of p21Ras farnesylation
is not likely to account for the main effects of the drug. On
the  other  hand,  the  peptidomimetic  FTI  L-739,749  has
been  reported  to  prevent  Ras-induced  transformation
through inhibition of Rho-B prenylation [31] with a block
in cell proliferation, increased apoptosis [41] and major
changes in stress fiber formation, cell shape and mobility.
None of these characteristic changes in cell morphology
and architecture was observed upon prolonged exposure
to  RPR-130401  (Figure  6), which  seems  to  rule  out  any
member of the Rho family as a target for RPR-130401.

Considering the efficient pre-mitotic block and hyperploi-
dy induced by RPR-130401, as also found with other FTIs
[16,29,30,42], it is tempting to postulate that the target of
the  drug  is  a  protein  involved  at  some  stage  in  mitosis
and/or  cytokinesis,  and  whose  farnesylation  is  required
for  proper  activation.  Indeed,  protein  isoprenylation  is
important  at  the  G2/M  transition  in  Schizosaccharomyces
pombe[43] and nuclear lamins are major targets for FTase
[18,44]. Lamin B farnesylation,  which is a very  sensitive
target for RPR-130401 in vitro[6], appears to deserve con-

support to  this scheme is given  by  immunofluorescence
experiments showing that the intranuclear distribution of
lamin  B  is  profoundly  altered  in  cells  exposed  to  RPR-
130401 (Figure 5). This occurred without lamin B break-
down (Figure 8), consistent with lack of a significant level
of apoptosis in the three cell lines used. Interestingly SCH-
66336,  another  FTI,  reportedly  allows  accumulation  of
unfarnesylated prelamin A in patients under phase I inves-
tigation [1] and in several cell lines in culture as well [48].
It has also been shown that SCH-66336 induces diruption
of  microtubule  binding  to  the  centromeric  proteins
CENP-E and CENP-F [17], thus evoking again faulty mito-
sis as an important outcome of FTI exposure.

Conclusions
Oncogenic Ras expression has been reported to have dif-
ferent outcomes in rodent and human cells with regard to
radiation susceptibility.  Studies  in mouse [49–52]  or  rat
cells [51,53–59] relied on transfection with N-Ras[49,50],
H-Ras[51,53–58]  or  co-transfection  with  H-Ras  and
myc[53–55],  [58–60].  Except  in  one  study  [51],  the  au-
thors have conclusively shown that transformation of ro-
dent  cells  with  the  Ras  oncogenes  results  in  enhanced
radiation resistance. Co-transfection with H-Ras and  myc
was found to act synergistically with regard to induction of
the  radioresistant  phenotype  [53,54,58–60],  possibly  in
relation to inhibition of myc-dependent apoptosis [58,61].

With  two exceptions in  support of increased radioresist-
ance [62,63], early studies on human cells did not show
any  clear-cut  relationship  between  radiation  sensitivity
and  expression  of  oncogenic  Ras[64–67].  In  addition,  a
study involving a cohort of patients with stage II and III
carcinoma of the uterine cervix, demonstrated the absence
of  a  significant  correlation  between  rearrangements  or
structure of the Ha-ras-1 and/or c-myc genes and tumor re-
sponse to radiotherapy [68]. However, the contribution of
N-  or K-Ras activation  to  intrinsic  radioresistance  in  hu-
man cells has recently been adressed directly, i.e., without
the perturbations introduced by cell transformation [69].
The  mechanisms  involved  in  Ras-related  radioresistance
are still open to question, but it might reasonably be pro-
posed  that  it  proceeds  from  constitutive  activation  of
pathways  dowstream  from  Ras  in  signal  transduction,
such as raf-1 [70] or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [71].

Whether  and  how  FTase  inhibition  may  affect  the  re-
sponse of cells to ionizing radiation has also been a long-
standing problem.  The outcome appears to depend very
much on the cell line and the specificity of the FTI used.
The FTase  inhibitor  FTI-277 reportedly acted  as  a  radio-
sensitizer  in  H-Ras-transformed  rat  embryo  fibroblasts
[72] and in human tumor cells harboring H-Ras mutation
[73].  On  the  other  hand,  the  radiation  susceptibility  of
human tumor cells expressing the wild-type form of Ras

Western blot analysis of lamin B in extracts from control and
treated cells. Cells were incubated for 5-days in 75 cm2 flasks
with  500  nM  (HCT-116),  7.1 µM  (A-549)  or  1.2  µM  (MiA-
PaCa-2) RPR-130401. A blank was also prepared for each cell
line. The number of cells at the time of cell lysis, was in the
range  107.  At  the  end  of  treatment,  the  flasks  were  rinsed
twice  with  ice-cold  PBS  and  cells  lysed  in  PHEM  buffer  as
described under Materials and Methods. An  aliquot of each
extract  (20  µg  total  protein)  was  loaded  in  the  wells  of  a
7.5% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis was performed
under usual conditions with molecular weight standards, fol-
lowed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The mem-
brane  was  incubated  with  a  mouse  monoclonal  antibody
directed against human lamin B and revealed through chemi-
luminescence detection (see Materials and Methods).

sideration as a candidate to this role. As a matter of fact,
among the three major type A-C lamins, lamin A and lam-
in B are initially translated with a CAAX motif. This motif
is cleaved upon post-translational maturation of lamin A
but persists in lamin B, unless the C-terminal aminoacid
residue is mutated [23]. Studies with mutant lamin delet-
ed of the CAAX sequence have shown that the CAAX motif
is essential to anchoring lamin B to the nuclear envelope
[45,46]; moreover, farnesylation is required for the inte-
gration of newly synthesized lamins into the pre-existing
nuclear lamina during interphase, and GGTase is unable
to substitute for FTase at this stage [47].

These  data altogether  suggest  that inhibition of  lamin B
farnesylation  could  be  an  important  target  of  RPR-
130401, resulting in an aberrant onset of mitosis and cy-
tokinesis and ensuing hyperploid cell generation. Strong

was  not  altered  by  FTIs  [73].  However,  enhanced  radia-
tion  response  by  FTI-277  has  been  described  in  human
cells  expressing  wild-type  Ras  together  with  the  24-kDa
isoform (FGF2) of basic fibroblast growth factor, a factor
involved in acquired radioresistance [74]. This was taken
as an indication that farnesylated proteins other than Ras
might  be  involved  in  the  modulation  of  radiation  re-
sponse by FTI-277 [74]. Weak radiosensitization only was
obtained with FTI-277 in K-Ras mutants, unless FTI-277
was  combined  with  GGTI-298  to  hinder  geranylgeranyl
transfer to K-Ras [73]. Last but not least FTI-induced radi-
osensitization, when it  occurs, seems to be independent
on the growth inhibitory effect of the FTI [73].

We show here that RPR-130401 does not significantly al-
ter the radiation susceptibility of human cells bearing K-
Ras  mutation.  This  occurs  in  spite  of  significant  hyper-
ploidization, accumulation of cells in G2 and depletion of
S phase. Finally, impaired repair of radiation damage by
RPR-130401,  appears  to  be  very  unlikely  to  occur.  This
seems valuable in the prospect of combining RPR-130401
as an adjuvant to conventional radiotherapy, as it should
provide strictly additive interaction without the local and
systemic adverse effects inherent in treatments with radia-
tion  sensitizers  [75].  In  this  respect  it  is  very  exciting  to
note that two farnesyltransferase inhibitors, FTI-276 and
L-744,832, have recently proven to act synergistically with
ionizing  radiation  in  vivo  for  growth  inhibition  of
xenotransplanted  H-Ras-mutated  human  tumor  cells,
without increase in acute or long-term radiation-induced
damage to healthy tissues [76].

Materials and methods
Reagents
RPR-130401 was synthesized as described [77] and stored
at -20°C as a 20 mM stock solution in DMSO. Prior to use,
the  solution  was  diluted  first  into  medium  containing
20%  DMSO,  then  to  the  final  concentration  in  culture
medium. DMSO was kept below 0.1% so as not to alter
cell growth or radiation response.

Colcemid and all products from cell culture were from In-
vitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France). BrdUrd, propidium io-
dide,  bisbenzimide,  DAPI,  Giemsa 
stain,  TRITC-
phalloidin  and  mouse  anti-α-tubulin  monoclonal  anti-
body  (clone  DM1A)  came  from  Sigma-Aldrich  (Saint-
Quentin-Fallavier,  France).  Mouse  monoclonal  antibod-
ies directed against lamin B was from Oncogene Research
Products (San Diego, California). FITC-conjugated sheep
anti-mouse  IgG  was  from  Sanofi-Synthélabo  (Paris,
France).  Alexa®  488  goat  anti-mouse  IgG  conjugate  was
from  Molecular  Probes  (Eugene,  Oregon).  Rat  mono-
clonal  antibody  directed  against  BrdUrd  was  purchased
from Harlan Sera-Lab (Loughborough, United Kingdom),
and  fluorescein  isothiocyanate-conjugated  goat  anti-rat

IgG (heavy chain specific) was from Southern Biotechnol-
ogy  Associates  (Birmingham,  Alabama).  Human  centro-
mere  probes  for  FISH  was  obtained  from  QBiogene
(Illkirch,  France).  Solvents  and  chemicals  were  of  the
highest  purity  available  and  came  from  Merck  Eurolab
(Paris, France).

Cell culture
HCT-116 human colon carcinoma (ATCC CCL-247), MiA-
PaCa-2  human  pancreatic  carcinoma  (ATCC  CRL-1420)
and A-549 human lung carcinoma cells (ATCC CCL-185)
were grown as monolayers in DMEM (HCT-116, MiAPaCa-
2) or RPMI-1640 (A-549 cells) containing sodium pyruvate
and Glutamax I, and supplemented with 10% foetal calf se-
rum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml  streptomycin.
Cells  were  routinely  subcultured  after  trypsinization  at  a
density of 6,000 cells/cm2 in culture flasks every 5-days and
incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2
in air. Less than 9–10 passages of the same primary subcul-
ture were allowed. Prior to seeding, cells were rinsed twice
with  HBSS,  harvested  by  trypsin-EDTA  treatment  and
counted in an hemocytometer.

Survival assays
Radiation survival with or without combined drug expo-
sure was determined by clonogenic assays. For determina-
tion  of  the  response  to  radiation  alone,  cells  from
exponentially growing subcultures were seeded in 25 cm2
flasks at  the  suitable density, incubated  for 3-h to allow
cells to adhere and spread, and irradiated in culture medi-
um at room temperature in an IBL-637 (137Cs) irradiator
(CIS-Biointernational,  Saclay,  France)  at  a  dose-rate  of
0.92 Gy/min. All experiments were performed in triplicate
or more.

Two protocols were used in single or combined treatment
assays. For short lengths of drug exposure (≤ 12-h), 1,000
cells were plated in triplicate in 25 cm2 flasks and incubat-
ed for 3-h. Cells were then exposed to drug for 1-, 2-, 3-,
4- or 12-h, irradiated and returned to the incubator for 1-
h in the presence of RPR-130401, followed by two washes
with HBSS and feeding with drug-free medium. Colonies
were allowed to grow for 8–11 days, then fixed with meth-
anol, stained with Giemsa and scored. Small colonies (<
30–50 cells) were disregarded. Results were corrected for
cell multiplicity (see below).

Where the length of drug exposure was in excess of 12-h,
cells  were plated  after treatments  to  avoid  biases  due  to
the formation of microcolonies. Typically, cells were plat-
ed in 25 cm2 flasks and exposed to drug for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or
5-days, and irradiated. Seeding was adjusted so as to ob-
tain  an equal  number  of cells at the time of irradiation,
taking  into  consideration  the  cytostatic  effect  of  the  FTI
and  the  length  of  drug  exposure.  Each  flask  was

trypsinized  immediately  after  irradiation,  the  cells  were
counted and 1,000 cells per flask were replated in drug-
free medium for colony formation assays.

Flow cytometry and cytogenetic analysis
Cell cycle progression was monitored by dual parameter
flow  cytometry  using  a  FACStar  PLUS  cytofluorometer
(Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France). Cells were
grown  for  3- to  6-days with  or  without  RPR-130401.  At
that time,  flasks  were irradiated to 3.5 Gy (HCT-116), 5
Gy (A-549) or 5.5 Gy (MiAPaCa-2) and allowed to rest in
the  incubator  for  24-h  prior  to  fixation.  15-min  before
harvesting, cells were incubated with BrdUrd (10 µM) for
pulse-labeling  of  S-phase  cells,  then  collected,  washed
once  with  cold  PBS  and  fixed  in  70%  ice-cold  ethanol.
Treatment of fixed cells for cytofluorimetric analysis, data
acquisition  and  processing  were  done  according  to  De-
marcq et al.[78]. Cell cycle analysis was  performed with
ProCyt software (CEA-INSERM, Grenoble, France).

Alternatively, HCT-116 treated cells were incubated with
0.2 µg/ml colcemid for 1-h, washed twice with HBSS and
allowed to swell for 30-min in 75 mM KCl hypotonic so-
lution. Cells were then fixed in 3:1 v/v methanol:acid ace-
tic in ice and washed threefold in the same solvent. Fixed
cells  were  dropped  onto  glass  slides  to  spread  chromo-
somes, and air dried. Slides were stained with Giemsa be-
fore scoring.

Immunofluorescence
For  immunofluorescence  characterization,  cells  were
grown on 20 × 20 mm coverslips in medium containing
10%  foetal  calf  serum  for  3-  to  6-days  with  or  without
RPR-130401. At that time, the coverslips were irradiated
to 3.5 Gy (HCT-116), 5 Gy (A-549) or 5.5 Gy (MiAPaCa-
2) and allowed to rest in the incubator for 24-h prior to
fixation.

To  visualize  polymerized  actin  and  tubulin,  cells  were
processed according to Mies et al.[79]. Briefly, cells were
fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1-
min, followed by 10-min in freshly prepared 4% formal-
dehyde and extensive washing. The coverslips were then
incubated (30-min, 37°C) with 0.2 µg/ml TRITC-labeled
phalloidin,  or  with  a  1:200  working  dilution  of  mono-
clonal anti-α tubulin antibody followed by a 30-min in-
cubation  with  a  1:1,000  dilution  of  FITC-conjugated
sheep anti-mouse IgG at 37°C.

To visualize lamin, cells were fixed in acetone/methanol
(1:1,  v/v)  for  20-min  at  -20°C,  allowed  to  air  dry,  then
washed 3 times with PBS and treated with 0.5% Triton X-
100 for 5-min at 4°C to permeabilize cells. The coverslips
were  incubated  (30-min,  37°C)  with  5  µg/ml  of  mono-
clonal anti-lamin B antibody followed by a 30-min incu-

bation  with  1:500  Alexa®  488  goat  anti-mouse  IgG
conjugate.

To  visualize  nuclei,  the  cells  were  counter-stained  with
bisbenzimide  (0.2  µg/ml)  or  DAPI  (0.12  µg/ml).  Cells
were  viewed  on  a  Zeiss  microscope  and  photographed
with Ilford HP-5 film.

Western blots
For determination of lamin B cleavage, HCT-116, A-549
and MiAPaCa-2 cells were exposed for 5-days at 10 × IC50
each of RPR-130401. At the end of treatment, cells were
harvested in PBS with 2 mM EDTA and lysed for 20-min
on  ice  with  gentle  agitation  in  PHEM  buffer  (80  mM
PIPES, 80 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1%
Triton X-100, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 10
µg/ml aprotinin and 1 µg/ml each of leupeptin and pep-
statin. The insoluble fraction, containing lamin B, was re-
covered by centrifugation, solubilized in Laemmli buffer
(3% lauryl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol,
62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and titrated.

An aliquot (20 µg total protein) of each extract was loaded
onto 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and blot-
ted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Ger-
many). The membrane was saturated with bovine serum
albumine and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-
body directed against lamin B. Protein detection was car-
ried  out  using  a  peroxidase-conjugated  goat  anti-mouse
secondary antibody and an ECL kit (Amersham Pharma-
cia Biotech, Orsay, France). Quantification was performed
by  densitometry  with  the  aid  of  QuantityOne®  software
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, California).

Curve fittings and correction for cellular multiplicity
Care  was taken to  avoid contamination of seed cell sus-
pensions  by  clusters,  as  their  presence  introduces  large,
systematic  errors  in  viability  measurements  with  clono-
genic assays [80]. For this reason, the cellular multiplicity,
i.e., the number of cells per potential colony-forming unit
was  carefully  checked  by  microscope  observation  at  the
time of irradiation throughout the whole study. When the
average multiplicity was less than 1.1 (for 1- and 2-h drug
exposure),  no  correction  was  applied.  Corrections  were
necessary for longer lengths of drug exposure (≥ 3-h), be-
cause viable colony-forming units contained a substantial
amount  of  doublets  and  quadruplets  at  these  times.  In
that case, the equation:

culate the single-cell surviving fraction (SCSF).
